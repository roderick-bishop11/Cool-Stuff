# The cool stuff repo


This repo is where I put the stuff that wows me. In short, its a catch-all for anything that doesn't merit it's own repo.

In here you might find some code that I wrote or some code that I saw and found very cool. Some of this code I became familiar with becauseof school
or I've seen in another place. I'll try to give credit where I can in READMEs as well.
